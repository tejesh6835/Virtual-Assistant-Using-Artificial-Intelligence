# Virtual-Assistant-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
This is Artificial Intelligence based Virtual Assistant. It works on only through voice commands.
An AI personal assistant is a piece of software that understands verbal commands and completes task assigned by the client. 
It is an example of weak AI that is it can only execute and perform quest designed by the user. 
In some cases, agents are exclusively for entertainment purposes. Some virtual assistants are ready to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. 
Users can ask their assistants questions, play songs, shutdown, restart ,lock window and manage other basic tasks like email, to- do lists, and calendars etc with verbal commands.
The Main idea of our project is to develop a virtual assistant which works based on our voice commands and does automation of tasks. 
The assistant helps the user to perform his/her functions make his work more easier. 
It will be implemented with the concept of Natural Language Processing(NLP) which is a branch of AI that deals with interaction of computers and human languages.
